# Facade-Design-Pattern
Facade Design Pattern

An important structual design patterns. provides a lobby/an easy interface to complex subsystems.

In this example I attempted to show how a Typical ATM machine takes User's input to address

1. cash withdrawal
2. Balance check
3. mini statement
4. cash deposit

Each one of the above is complex task by itself, ATM facade hides all these complex working and serves the user.
